## What is this?

For more information on this repo, including how to use it, please see my blog post.

## Installation

You'll need [The Luggage](https://github.com/unixorn/luggage). You can use this code with [Munki](https://github.com/munki/munki), but you don't have to.

There's a bunch of stuff you'll need to customize before building the pkg. I strongly recommend opening each script and changing the placeholders I added.
